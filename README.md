# TriviaMaze
##Software Engineering Course group project
We developed a game where a character progresses through a maze by answering trivia, collecting keys, and unlocking doors. Our goals were to implement an application using design patterns (described in the UML Diagrams folder), version control, and agile methods. My contributions where the SQLite database build and management in src/TriviaQuestions along with the maze generation code in src/MazeGeneration. This was my first project so there are not-quite-best practices like rolling my own ArrayStack and forgetting to close opened files!
