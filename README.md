# TriviaMaze
##Software Engineering Course group project
We developed a game where a character progresses through a maze by answering movie trivia, collecting keys, and unlocking doors. Our goals were to implement a full stack application using design patterns (described in the UML Diagrams folder), version control, and agile methods. My contributions where a SQLite database that stores the trivia as well as the maze generation code.
