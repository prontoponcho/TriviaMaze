# TriviaMaze
##Group Project from CSCD350 Software Engineering
We made a game where a character progresses through a maze by answering movie trivia, collecting keys, and unlocking doors. 
I implemented the SQLite database that stores the trivia as well as the maze generation code. At this point I was still very new to programming
and group projects, so please excuse any oddities =)
