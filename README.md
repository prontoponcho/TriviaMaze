# TriviaMaze
##Software Engineering Course group project
We developed a game where a character progresses through a maze by answering trivia, collecting keys, and unlocking doors. Our goals were to implement a database, use design patterns (UML Diagrams folder), version control (Github), and agile methods (Pivitol Tracker). 
My contributions where:
<ul>
  <li> SQLite database build and management code in src/TriviaQuestions</li>
  <li> random maze generation code in src/MazeGeneration</li>
</ul> 
This was my first project and there are a number of bad practices on display (like rolling my own ArrayStack and forgetting to close opened files!).
